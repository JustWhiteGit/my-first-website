It's important at this stage to point out that a good README.md file is essential.
If you submit your milestone projects without a README file, then they'll fail.
What should we put in a README.md file?
Well a good README.md file has a link to the live deployed project.
It helps the reader to understand what the project does, what technologies have been used, what features you'd like to add, and it also gives credit for any code that's been taken from other places such as libraries that you might have imported, or code you found on StackOverflow.
A detailed README.md file can really help the reader to get a feel for your project and your vision as a developer.
So this concludes our section on the command-line interface, Git and GitHub.
Some of the concepts will take practice until they become second nature.
But when it comes to Git, remember our moving van analogy which will help you to understand what Git is doing at each stage of the process.
